## What I practiced/learned:
 - The use of `display:grid` and `display:flex`.
 - Basic element styling/positioning.
 - Image resizinging and manipulation.
 - Grid-gap!
 - Starting with a solid plan is critical to successful projects. Poor management of HTML structures and CSS rulesets can cost us the ability to pivot styling and positioning as desired.
